# AI-POWERED-DATA-CLEANING-AND-DATA-ENHANCEMENT-SYSTEM

This project presents an AI-powered automated data cleaning and quality enhancement system designed to handle real-world power consumption datasets with high accuracy and efficiency. The system integrates a preprocessing pipeline that detects and handles missing values, inconsistent records, and outliers using advanced techniques such as Local Outlier Factor (LOF) for anomaly detection and imputation strategies for maintaining dataset continuity. A LightGBM model is employed for predictive analysis, offering fast and scalable performance, while SHAP-based feature analysis ensures explainability by highlighting the contribution of each feature to the modelâ€™s predictions. To make the solution interactive and practical, a Flask-based backend API was developed for real-time prediction, data inspection, and logging, supported by a lightweight SQLite database for storage and auditing. The outcome is a robust, modular, and interpretable data processing and prediction pipeline that reduces manual preprocessing effort, improves data quality, and delivers reliable insights, making it highly suitable for deployment in real-world scenarios and future research applications.
